# xmlm

Xmlm is a package for working with XML data in Gleam.

## Documentation & Usage

- For documentation and some usage examples, see the API docs in `src/xmlm.gleam`
- For complete XML processing examples, see the `test/examples` directory.

## Hacking

Check out the `justfile` for various utilities and helpers.  (You will need [just](https://just.systems/) installed to use it.)

### XML Conformance Tests

- XML Conformance tests are located in `test/xmlconf`. 
  - Within each subdirectory, there is a `gen.gleam` file that auto-generates the tests.
  - These files include some rules about when tests that are expected to fail according to the spec will actually pass in this package, and vice-versa.
- Corresponding XML test files are located in `test/test_files/xmlconf`. 
- To generate the tests, run `just gen_xmlconf_tests`.
  - Currently, only the oasis tests are used, but more will be incorporated.

### Benchmarks

You can run various benchmarks with:

- `just bench_compare_erlang`
- `just bench_compare_javascript`
- `just bench_signals_erlang`
- `just bench_signals_javascript`

Note that the JavaScript benchmarks are fairly slow to run.

### Profiling Erlang Code

Run the Erlang shell with `gleam shell`.  Then input the following:

```
fprof:trace(start).
bench@run_in_shell:main().
fprof:trace(stop).
fprof:profile().
fprof:analyse({dest, "_output/profile.fprof"}).
```

Once that finishes (it shouldn't take more than a few moments), then run `just erlgrind` to view the profile with kchachegrind.

Note that this requires both [kcachegrind](https://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/html/Home.html) and [erlgrind](https://github.com/isacssouza/erlgrind) to be installed.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Accept input sources other than string or bit array.  (Ideally, some sort of abstraction that would also allow processing a stream of data.)
